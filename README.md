# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis

## 🧾 Abstract
This project analyzes various medical attributes to identify key indicators related to heart disease. Using data-driven techniques, the project explores trends and relationships among clinical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more. Multiple visualizations were created to uncover patterns, improve awareness, and support early diagnosis efforts. This analysis was compiled and presented in a macro-enabled PowerPoint file for effective communication and demonstration.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing/null values.
- Converted categorical values (e.g., gender) into analyzable formats.
- Grouped data by age, gender, and heart disease status.

### 2. Visualization
- Pie charts to analyze gender and age distributions.
- Bar graphs and histograms to evaluate cholesterol and blood pressure levels.
- Correlation heatmaps to assess relationships between variables.

### 3. Interpretation
- Summarized all visual findings into actionable health insights.
- Created an interactive PowerPoint presentation for stakeholders.
